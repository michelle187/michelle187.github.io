			<h1>Questions</h1>
			<h2>Introduction to the World Wide Web (WWW): Explain how the web works, the role of web servers, what are web browsers?</h2>
		
			<p>The World Wide Web, also known as the Web is a system of interlinked, hypertext documents through the internet and internet servers.The web browser connects to the web server allows you to find the desired page by sending an HTTP request. It allows the retrieval of text, media and documents to your computer and allows you to link documents together to make a web of documents.</p>

			<p>A web server is a computer program that distributes web pages. It is a computer software that runs the internet. The goal of a web server is to be able to store, process and deliver web pages to the users. This process uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and can also use File Transfer Protocol (FTP).</p>


			<p>A web browser is an application software which allows you to access and view websites and the World Wide Web. Every user uses a web browser, common web browsers include Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari.</p>

			

			<h2>How is the world wide web different to the internet?</h2>
			<p>The internet is the network which connects millions computers and also allows devices to access the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web is billions of pages that can be accessed through the internet, it allows you to see the pages through a device that is used. The difference between the internet and the world wide web is that the internet is the network that connects the devices, whereas the World Wide Web are pages you see, this could be information on a shop or etc. The internet is the network that the World Wide Web works on.</p>

			<h2>What it an intranet? How does it relate to the internet?</h2>
			<p>An intranet is a computer network which is used in companies to have a private and secure network that only their workers and organisations can have access to. It works like the world wide web however is only restricted to those authorized. It allows employees to be able to communicate, store information all privately. Both the intranet and internet serve the purposes to communicate and share information, however the internet is a globally connected network, whereas the intranet is a local or restricted network.</p>

			<h2>What is an internet protocol? Compare HTTP, TCP/IP and FTP</h2>

			<p>The Internet Protocol is a set of rules and requirements for governing how the format of data is addressed and routed via the internet or local network. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), is an application layer protocol for transmitting hypertext messages or documents between clients and servers. Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), is communication protocols used in the internet and similar computer networks and also to interconnect network devices. File Transfer Protocol (FTP), is a standard communication protocol used for transferring files over the internet, from a server to a client on a computer network.</p>
			<p>The difference between HTTP and FTP is that HTTP used to access websites on the internet. Whereas FTP is used to transfer files from one place to another. HTTP is better for transferring smaller files, and FTP is better for transferring large files. Both use TCP as the protocol of choice, however HTTP uses a persistent connection, which makes HTTP have a better performance than FTP with TCP. </p>
